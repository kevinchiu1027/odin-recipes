        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Golden and crisp on top and just barely cooked at the center, this pan seared salmon is one of my go-to recipes when I have to hit the kitchen running. Not only is it fast — 15 minutes start to finish — it’s also elegant. In fact, it’s the way salmon is typically prepared in fine dining restaurants. This is really more of a technique than a recipe, and it’s easy to master at home.</p>
